# Naive Implementation

The implementation here treats each column of the dataset as a ciphertext. This is a naive,
but understandable simplification. However, this brings about many issues with state tracking,
a complicated implementation, and more. The code here exists to serve as a benchmark, and to allow attendees
to understand how they themselves might have stumbled upon an efficient implementation had they not attended this
tutorial.

We refer interested readers to the code in the [efficient regression](../efficient_regression) folder for a
better implementation.
