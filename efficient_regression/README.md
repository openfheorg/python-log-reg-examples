# Optimizations

- packing all of the training data into a single ciphertext.
  - Need to refresh/bootstrap fewer ciphertexts

- implementing NAG

- optimization by doing transpose and multiplication by -1 in plaintext

- packing the weights into a single ciphertext and masking things out to extract them
